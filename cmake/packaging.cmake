Expandable And Scalable Infrastructure for Finite Element Methods,

useful components which are necessary for building higher level classes
of finite element code.

# A description of the project, used in places such as the introduction screen
# of CPack-generated Windows installers. If not set, the value of this variable

set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION "${PROJECT_VERSION}")

set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "${VERSION_MAJOR}")
# Package major version. This variable will always be set, but its default value
# depends on whether or not version details were given to the project() command
# in the top level CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the
# default value will be CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR. If no version details were
# given, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to
# CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR having a default value of 0.

set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "${VERSION_MINOR}")
# Package minor version. The default value is determined based on whether or not
# version details were given to the project() command in the top level
# CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the default value willbe
# CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR, but if no minor version component was specified
# then CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR will be left unset. If no project version was
# given at all, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to
# CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR having a default value of 1.

set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH "${VERSION_BugFix}")

# version details were given to the project() command in the top level
# CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the default value will be
# CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH, but if no patch version component was specified
# then CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH will be left unset. If no project version was
# given at all, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to
# CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH having a default value of 1.

# CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON A branding image that will be displayed inside the
# installer (used by GUI installers).

set(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/LICENSE")
# License to be embedded in the installer. It will typically be displayed to the
# user by the produced installer (often with an explicit "Accept" button, for
# graphical installers) prior to installation. This license file is NOT added to
# the installed files but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you
# want to use UTF-8 characters, the file needs to be encoded in UTF-8 BOM. If
# you want to install a license file (may be the same as this one) along with
# your project, you must add an appropriate CMake install() command in your
# CMakeLists.txt.

# CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README
set(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/README.md")
# ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer. It typically describes in some
# detail the purpose of the project during the installation. Not all CPack
# generators use this file.

# CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME Welcome file to be embedded in the installer. It
# welcomes users to this installer. Typically used in the graphical installers
# on Windows and Mac OS X.

# CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL¶ Disables the component-based installation mechanism.
# When set, the component specification is ignored and all installed items are
# put in a single "MONOLITHIC" package. Some CPack generators do monolithic
# packaging by default and may be asked to do component packaging by setting
# CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL to TRUE.

# CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM¶ An algorithm that will be used to generate an
# additional file with the checksum of the package. The output file name will
# be:

set(CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/package)
# The directory in which CPack is doing its packaging. If it is not set then
# this will default (internally) to the build dir. This variable may be defined
# in a CPack config file or from the cpack command line option -B. If set, the
# command line option overrides the value found in the config file.

set(CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME})
# Installation directory on the target system. This may be used by some CPack
# generators like NSIS to create an installation directory e.g., "CMake 2.5"
# below the installation prefix. All installed elements will be put inside this
# directory.

list(APPEND CpackGen DEB)
# TGZ
set(CPACK_GENERATOR "${CpackGen}")
# SET(CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR "TGZ DEB")

# List of CPack generators to use. If not specified, CPack will create a set of
# options following the naming pattern CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> (e.g.
# CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user to enable/disable individual generators.
# If the -G option is given on the cpack command line, it will override this
# variable and any CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> options.

# CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE The name of the CPack binary configuration file. This

# CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE¶ The name of the CPack source configuration
# file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module for
# source installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.

# CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES¶ Lists each of the executables and associated text
# label to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts. For example, setting this to
# the list ccmake;CMake will create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute
# the installed executable ccmake. Not all CPack generators use it (at least
