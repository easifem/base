SET(CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES YES)
# If set to TRUE, values of variables prefixed with CPACK_ will be escaped
# before being written to the configuration files, so that the cpack

# received by the cpack program. Defaults to FALSE for

"
Expandable And Scalable Infrastructure for Finite Element Methods,

easifemBase is a critical part of EASIFEM framework. It contains many
useful components which are necessary for building higher level classes
of finite element code.

SET(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION "${PROJECT_VERSION}")

SET(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "${VERSION_MAJOR}")
# Package major version. This variable will always be set, but its default
# value depends on whether or not version details were given to the project()
# command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given,
# the default value will be CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR. If no version details
# were given, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to
# CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR having a default value of 0.

SET(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "${VERSION_MINOR}")
# Package minor version. The default value is determined based on whether or
# not version details were given to the project() command in the top level
# CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the default value willbe
# CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR, but if no minor version component was specified
# then CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR will be left unset. If no project version
# was given at all, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to
# CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR having a default value of 1.

SET(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH "${VERSION_BugFix}")
# Package patch version. The default value is determined based on whether
# or not version details were given to the project() command in the top
# level CMakeLists.txt file. If version details were given, the default
# value will be CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH, but if no patch version
# component was specified then CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH will be left
# unset. If no project version was given at all, a default version of
# 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH having
# a default value of 1.


# CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON
# A branding image that will be displayed inside the installer (used by GUI installers).

SET(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/LICENSE")
# License to be embedded in the installer. It will typically be displayed to the user by the produced installer (often with an explicit "Accept" button, for graphical installers) prior to installation. This license file is NOT added to the installed files but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you want to use UTF-8 characters, the file needs to be encoded in UTF-8 BOM. If you want to install a license file (may be the same as this one) along with your project, you must add an appropriate CMake install() command in your CMakeLists.txt.

# CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README
set(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/README.md")
# ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer. It typically describes in some detail the purpose of the project during the installation. Not all CPack generators use this file.

# CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME
# Welcome file to be embedded in the installer. It welcomes users to this installer. Typically used in the graphical installers on Windows and Mac OS X.

# CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL¶
# Disables the component-based installation mechanism. When set, the component specification is ignored and all installed items are put in a single "MONOLITHIC" package. Some CPack generators do monolithic packaging by default and may be asked to do component packaging by setting CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL to TRUE.

# CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM¶
# An algorithm that will be used to generate an additional file with the checksum of the package. The output file name will be:

SET(CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/package)
# The directory in which CPack is doing its packaging. If it is not set then
# this will default (internally) to the build dir.
# This variable may be defined in a CPack config file or from the cpack
# command line option -B.
# If set, the command line option overrides the value found in the
# config file.

SET(CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME} )
# Installation directory on the target system. This may be used by
# some CPack generators like NSIS to create an installation directory
#  e.g., "CMake 2.5" below the installation prefix.
# All installed elements will be put inside this directory.

# List of CPack generators to use. If not specified, CPack will create a set of options following the naming pattern CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> (e.g. CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user to enable/disable individual generators. If the -G option is given on the cpack command line, it will override this variable and any CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME> options.

# List of files to be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0, CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).

# CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE
# The name of the CPack binary configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module for binary installers. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.

# CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE¶
# The name of the CPack source configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module for source installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.


# CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES¶
# Lists each of the executables and associated text label to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts. For example, setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the installed executable ccmake. Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS, and WIX do).
